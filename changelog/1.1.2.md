## 1.1.2 changelog

I goofed.  1.1.1 has a bad gemspec and some critical bugs.

## Features

### Improvements to `briar xtc`

* Adds support for targeting XTC series.
* Can now wait run xtc as async or sync.
* Adjusts how and when bundler is called when submitted an XTC job.

See `$ briar help xtc`.
