## 1.1.0 changelog

This release improves the `$ briar install < device >` and `$ briar xtc` commands.

## features

* [pull 8](https://github.com/jmoody/briar/pull/8) added language keys for Danish and Thai
    - thanks @crishoj

* [pull 12](https://github.com/jmoody/briar/pull/12) briar now retries ideviceinstaller commands on failures

* [pull 13](https://github.com/jmoody/briar/pull/13) briar xtc command now executes all commands in the context of `bundle exec`
    
## deprecated

- 1.1.0 `:reinstall` is no longer a valid `ideviceinstaller` command - `:install` will always delete the existing .ipa from the device and reinstall.
